    <p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes skin removed and chopped</li>
        <li>5-10 springs each parsley and cilantro - tied together</li>
        <li>1 sweet potato cleaned and cut into similar size pieces as the squash</li>
        <li>2-3 chunks of squash (butternut/pumpkin/acorn)</li>
       <li> 1 small turnip, cut into quarters</li>
       <li> 3 - 5 carrots, cleaned and quartered</li>
        <li>1/4 wedge green cabbage</li>
        <li>1/2 can chickpeas</li>
        <li>2 medium zucchini, cleaned and quartered</li>
        <li>1 small eggplant, ends removed and cut into quarters</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
         <li>In the bottom of the couscousierre, add the oil and turn the heat to medium. Begin by cooking the onions until they start to become translucent.</li>
<li>Add in 10 cups of water, along with the tomato and spices; salt, pepper, turmeric, ginger as well as the cilantro and parsley bundle. Keep the heat on medium low.</li>
<li>The first vegetables you will want to add are the hardest; sweet potato, turnip, squash etc as they need the longest cooking time. While these go in the pot complete the first steam of the couscous.</li><li>At the end of the first steam (approximately 20 minutes), fluff the couscous and prepare the second batch of vegetables. This would include the carrots, chickpeas, and cabbage.</li>
<li>After the second steam (another 20 minutes) you'll add the remaining vegetables. I add the hot pepper at the end but if you want the heat to really get into your broth you can cook it in from the beginning.</li><li>Finally the third steam (15-20 minutes) is complete and your couscous is ready to serve!</li>
</ol>
